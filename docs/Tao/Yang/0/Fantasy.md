## Zodiacs

If Zodiacs are part of the Fantasy World, then we should care what fantasy tell us about.

If Chakras are part of the Fantasy World, then we should care what fantasy tell us about.

- [Logic](../../../Yin/1/Logic/Logic.md): Focus

## Focus

If Your attention create the necessary imaginary structure to understand anything which the mind create, then is only fantasy. In any case we always should care what fantasy tell us about.

## Concepts

Concepts are abstractions, abstractions create tools to produce fantasy ( objects, forms, values, symbols ) so we can compare them and learn about the concept. May we understand that is pure fantasy.

## Religions

Naturaly Religions care to educate Ideas, Concepts and all kind of abstractions which guide to a balanced behavior. While everything is only an illusion, I can ask you what is not! Maybe religions aim to be a way to educate.
