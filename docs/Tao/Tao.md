## Privacy Concerns: Data Base

This project "Care" about Privacy.

- The user decide his/her privacy. 
- This platform will Not ask the user to add more personal information that the user already care to share by registration process. 
- Actions need to have more information about the user. GPS & Time Zone
- GPS points & Time Zone information will be recorded in text format in User profile Actions List, with refered Path. 
- <b>Note</b>: Only Reported Videos which are reported as an Abuse which Violate License Principles, are not Deleted. 
- Privacy Rights can be Violated at Action Time in HCP (Human Care Path). Because the Video serves as a Concept Proof, while in rating process, videos must be viewed by someone else. (random) When Video have a Final Stage (approved or Denied), Video Shall be Deleted!
- GPS + Time Zone information is used to add as Note in each Approved User Action and add it in a World Map as a Pixel which refers an Action made in that Point of the Planet.  
- This challenge don't care about how much secure You are, but if the actions are made. Secure communications sometimes are slow and not good to Real Time Video Recording. If Player Have a good connetion, player only needs an email to start playing. 
 
### Logic: The BlockChain - The Eco System

##### 1 Approved Action === 1 Point ||  1 Point === +1 coin

##### 1 Denied Action === 0 Points ||  0 Points === +0 Coins

#### Notes:

- Each Video Shall be Viewed and approved at least 6 times without 1 deny in sequence to be finaly approved and return 1 point to the Author of the video. 
- If Video is denied 6 times in sequence, video is deleted and user gain 0 points.
- if video is reported 3 times in sequence : this video goes into the <b>Black Box</b>
- The <b>Black Box</b> is a system where some "good" users care to recheck the content of the video. Depending on "how bad" is, can be publicly exposed in the Public Report Section of this website, with all information about the user and the video it self. User email and Social Media Account are blocked. 
#### CryptoCoins Respective Challenge:
- CryptoCoins Communities Should care about the Energy that is spend by each single user of this Competition. If one Approved action represents Value, a CryptoCoin Should be given to each User Approved Action.
